# Url_Shortner
An URL shortener is a website that reduces the length of your URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The idea is to minimize the web page address into something that's easier to remember and track. The URL shortening service will maintain the connection between the new link and the original URL. This means that anyone who clicks new shorten link will be redirected to the original page.
